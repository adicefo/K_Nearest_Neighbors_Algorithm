# About

K-Nearest Neighbors is supervised machine learing method that is used for classification and regression problems.The K-NN algorithm works by finding the K nearest neighbors to a given data point based on a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance. The class or value of the data point is then determined by the majority vote or average of the K neighbors. This approach allows the algorithm to adapt to different patterns and make predictions based on the local structure of the data.
